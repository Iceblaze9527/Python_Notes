# 01.2 Data Types and Structures 2: Sequences
[TOC]

## 1.3 List
### 1.3.1 List Operations
refer to [sequence operations](#seq)

- slicing can be used for modifying lists
- `max()`、`min()` 元素类型必须相同

### 1.3.2 Add Values to List
- [`list.append(obj)`](https://www.runoob.com/python3/python3-att-list-append.html): append a reference of `obj` in-place, returns `None`
- [`list.insert(index, obj)`](https://www.runoob.com/python3/python3-att-list-insert.html): insert a reference of `obj` in-place, returns `None`

### 1.3.3 [Concatenate Lists](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3653298/concatenating-two-lists-difference-between-and-extend)
- `list += new_list`: (naturally) extend a reference of `list` in-place
- [`list.extend(seq)`](https://www.runoob.com/python3/python3-att-list-extend.html): extend a reference of `seq` in-place, returns `None`

:::info
**Scoping issue:** You can't use `+=` for non-local variables (variables which are not local for the function and also not global)
:::

### 1.3.4 [Delete Values from List](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-difference-between-del-remove-and-pop-on-python-lists/)
- `del list[index]`: delete a reference of the value in-place, throws index error.
- [`list.remove(obj)`](https://www.runoob.com/python3/python3-att-list-remove.html): delete a reference of `obj` in-place, returns `None`, throws value error.
- [`list.pop([index=-1])`](https://www.runoob.com/python3/python3-att-list-pop.html): delete a reference of the value in-place, returns deleted value, throws index error.

### 1.3.5 [Empty List](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/850795/different-ways-of-clearing-lists)
- 1st: `list *= 0`: (naturally) clear a reference of `list` in-place
- 2nd: [`list.clear()`](https://www.runoob.com/python3/python3-att-list-clear.html), clear a reference of `list` in-place,, returns `None`
- 3rd: `del list[:]` $\equiv$ `list[:] = []`, clear a reference of `list` in-place
- `list = []` simply changes the reference

### 1.3.6 [Sort List](https://realpython.com/python-sort/#ordering-values-with-sort)
- [`list.sort(key=None, reverse=False)`](https://www.runoob.com/python3/python3-att-list-sort.html): sort a reference of `list` in-place, returns `None`
- `sorted(iterable, key=None, reverse=False)`: returns a sorted copy in `list`

:::info
Lists with non-comparable data types can’t be sorted
When you’re sorting strings, case matters
:::

### 1.3.7 [Reverse List](https://realpython.com/python-reverse-list/)
- [`list.reverse()`](https://www.runoob.com/python3/python3-att-list-reverse.html) : reverse a reference of `list` in-place, returns `None`
- `reversed(list)`: reversed copy that references the original list, returns an iterator that yields items in reverse order
- `list[::-1]`: reversed copy
- `list[slice(None,None,-1)]`: reversed copy

:::info
Compared to slicing, `reversed()` is more efficient in terms of execution time and memory usage, but slicing gives you a copy of list that does not affected by the original. 

`class slice(start, stop[, step])` creates a slice object that serves as an argument to be passed to slicing

Also, slicing is slow, you might want to use list comprehension (combined with `range()` and indexing) to speed up the program.

## 1.4 Tuple
### 1.4.1 Tuple Operations
refer to [sequence operations](#seq)

### 1.4.2 [Immutability of Tuples](https://realpython.com/courses/immutability-python/)
Basically, the promise of “immutability” on tuples is only partly true. The tuple itself cannot be modified, but objects referenced by the tuple can be. This is sometimes called “non-transitive immutability.” If the tuple has an immutable field like a string for example, then it cannot be modified. A mutable field like a list however, can be edited, even if it’s embedded in the “immutable” tuple.

tuple的元素所保存的内容（数值或内存地址）是不允许修改的，但地址映射的对象自身是可以修改的。元组所指向的内存实际上保存的是元组内数据的内存地址集合（即 **t[0], t[1]...t[n]** 的内存地址），且元组一旦建立，这个集合就不能增加修改删除，一旦集合内的地址发生改变，必须重新分配元组空间保存新的地址集（元组类似 C 语言里的指针数组，只不过这个数组不能被修改）。

When the Python documentation refers to an object as being “immutable” they mean the behavior above observed. Other immutable types in Python behave the same way, e.g. namedtuples or frozensets.

## 1.5 Range
```python
range(start, stop[, step])
```

The `range` type represents an immutable sequence of numbers and is commonly used for looping a specific number of times in `for` loops.

## 1.6 Sequence
There are three basic sequence types: lists, tuples, and range objects. Additional sequence types tailored for processing of [binary data](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#binaryseq) and [text strings](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#textseq) are described in dedicated sections.

### 1.6.2 Immutable Sequence Types
The only operation that immutable sequence types generally implement that is not also implemented by mutable sequence types is support for the [`hash()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#hash "hash") built-in.

This support allows immutable sequences, such as [`tuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple") instances, to be used as [`dict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict "dict") keys and stored in [`set`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set "set") and [`frozenset`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#frozenset "frozenset") instances.

Attempting to hash an immutable sequence that contains unhashable values will result in [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError").
