# 01.3 Data Types and Structures 3: Sets and Dicts
[TOC]

## 1.7 Set
A _set_ object is an unordered collection of distinct hashable objects. Common uses include membership testing, removing duplicates from a sequence, and computing mathematical operations such as intersection, union, difference, and symmetric difference.

### 1.7.1 Set vs Frozenset
There are currently two built-in set types, `set` and `frozenset`. The `set` type is mutable — the contents can be changed. Since it is mutable, it has no hash value and cannot be used as either a dictionary key or as an element of another set. The `frozenset` type is immutable and hashable — its contents cannot be altered after it is created; it can therefore be used as a dictionary key or as an element of another set.

### 1.7.2 Common Set Operations
- `elem in s`
- `elem not in s`
- `len(s)`
- `max(s)`
- `min(s)`
- `a - b`: difference (transitive)
- `a | b`: union (transitive)
- `a & b`: intersection (transitive)
- `a ^ b`: symmetric difference `(a | b) - (a - b)`
- `a <= b`: subset
- `a < b`: proper subset
- `a >= b`: superset
- `a > b`: proper superset
- `a == b`: equal

:::info
Instances of `set` are compared to instances of `frozenset` based on their members. For example, `set('abc') == frozenset('abc')` returns `True` and so does `set('abc') in set([frozenset('abc')]).`

Binary operations that mix `set` instances with `frozenset` return the type of the first operand. For example: `frozenset('ab') | set('bc')` returns an instance of `frozenset`.

### 1.7.3 Common Set Methods
- `set.difference(*others)`
- `set.union(*others)`
- `set.intersection(*others)`
- `set.symmetric_difference(*others)`
- `set.isdisjoint(other)`
- `set.issubset(other)`
- `set.issuperset(other)` 
- `set.copy()`: Return a shallow copy of the set.

The non-operator versions of methods will accept any iterable as an argument. In contrast, their operator based counterparts require their arguments to be sets. This precludes error-prone constructions like `set('abc') & 'cbs'` in favor of the more readable `set('abc').intersection('cbs')`.

### 1.7.4 Additional Mutable Operations
- `a -= b`: difference update
- `a |= b`: update
- `a &= b`: intersection update
- `a ^= b`: symmetric difference update

### 1.7.5 Additional Mutable Methods
- `set.difference_update(*others)`
- `set.update(*others)`
- `set.intersection_update(*others)`
- `set.symmetric_difference_update(*others)`

### 1.7.6 Element-wise Mutable Methods
- `s.add(elem)`
- `set.remove(elem)`: Raises `KeyError` if _elem_ is not contained in the set.
- `set.discard(elem)`: Remove element _elem_ from the set if it is present.
- `set.pop()`: Remove and return an arbitrary element from the set. Raises `KeyError` if the set is empty.
- `set.clear()`: Remove all elements from the set.
- `del set`: Delete the set completely

## 1.8 Dict
### 1.8.1 Dict Operations
- `key in dict`
- `key not in dict`
- `len(dict)`
- `dict | other`: Create a new dictionary with the merged keys and values of _dict_ and _other_, which must both be dictionaries. The values of _other_ take priority when _dict_ and _other_ share keys. (New in version 3.9)
- `dict |= other`: Update the dictionary _dict_ with keys and values from _other_, which may be either a mapping or an iterable of key/value pairs. The values of _other_ take priority when _dict_ and _other_ share keys. (New in version 3.9)
- `list(dict)`: Return a list of all the keys used in the dictionary. (not a view)

:::info
Dictionaries compare equal if and only if they have the same `(key, value)` pairs (regardless of ordering). Order comparisons (‘<’, ‘<=’, ‘>=’, ‘>’) raise `TypeError`

Dictionaries preserve insertion order. Note that updating a key does not affect the order. Keys added after deletion are inserted at the end. (New in Python 3.7)

### 1.8.2 Dict Item Methods
#### Access Items
- `dict[key]`: raise `KeyError`
- `dict.get([key], default=None)`

#### Add and Modify Items
- `dict[key] = value`
- `dict.setdefault(key, value)`: Returns the value of the specified key. If the key does not exist: insert the key, with the specified value
- `dict.update(another_dict)`
- `dict = {**dict, **another_dict}` (fastest)

#### Delete Items
- `dict.pop(key[, default])`
- `dict.popitem()`: The `popitem()` method removes the last inserted item (in versions before 3.7, a random item is removed instead)
- `del dict[key]`

### 1.8.3 Dict Methods
#### Create Dicts
- `dict.fromkeys(keys, value)`: The `fromkeys()` method returns a dictionary with the specified keys and the specified value. Uses reference for mutable values

#### Copy Dicts
- `dict.copy()`: Shallow Copy

#### Clear and Delete Dicts
- `dict.clear()`
- `del dict`

### 1.8.4 Retrieve Dict Views
- `dict.keys()`: The `keys()` method will return a `dict_keys` object of all the keys in the dictionary. 
- `dict.values()`: The `values()` method will return a `dict_values` object of all the values in the dictionary.
- `dict.items()`: The `items()` method will return each item in a dictionary, as tuples in a list.

The list of the keys/values/items is a view object of the dictionary, meaning that any changes done to the dictionary will be reflected in the list. 

Keys views are set-like since their entries are unique and hashable. If all values are hashable, so that `(key, value)` pairs are unique and hashable, then the items view is also set-like. (Values views are not treated as set-like since the entries are generally not unique.) For set-like views, all of the operations defined for the abstract base class `collections.abc.Set` are available (for example, `==`, `<`, or `^`).

#### Dict View Operations
- `x in dictview`
- `len(dictview)`
- `iter(dictview)`: Return an iterator over the keys, values or items (represented as tuples of `(key, value)`) in the dictionary. Keys and values are iterated over in insertion order. `iter(dict)` is a shortcut for `iter(dict.keys())`.
- `reversed(dictview)`: Return a reverse iterator over the keys, values or items of the dictionary. The view will be iterated in reverse order of the insertion. `reversed(dict)` is a shortcut for `reversed(dict.keys())`. (new in Python 3.8)
