# [01.A1 Data Types and Structures (Advanced) 1: Collections](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html)
[TOC]

## 1.A1 `deque`
```python
class collections.deque([iterable[, maxlen]])
```

Deques are a generalization of stacks and queues (the name is pronounced “deck” and is short for “double-ended queue”). Deques support thread-safe, memory efficient appends and pops from either side of the deque with approximately the same O(1) performance in either direction.

Though `list` objects support similar operations, they are optimized for fast fixed-length operations and incur O(n) memory movement costs for `pop(0)` and `insert(0, v)` operations which change both the size and position of the underlying data representation.

If _maxlen_ is not specified or is `None`, deques may grow to an arbitrary length. Otherwise, the deque is bounded to the specified maximum length. Once a bounded length deque is full, when new items are added, a corresponding number of items are discarded from the opposite end.

### 1.A1.1 `deque` Operations
- `deque[index]`: access and modify element. Indexed access is O(1) at both ends but slows to O(n) in the middle.
- `len(deque)`: get length
- `element in deque`
- `deque.index(x[, start[, stop]])`: Return the position of x in the deque (at or after index start and before index stop). Returns the first match or raises ValueError if not found. 
- `deque.count(x)`: Count the number of deque elements equal to x. 
- `deque.copy()`: Create a shallow copy of the deque. 

### 1.A1.2 Built-in Methods
#### Add Elements
- `deque.append(x)`: Add x to the right side of the deque. 
- `deque.appendleft(x):` Add x to the left side of the deque. 
- `deque.insert(i, x)`: Insert x into the deque at position i. If the insertion would cause a bounded deque to grow beyond maxlen, an `IndexError` is raised.

#### Extend `deque`
- `deque += sequence`: slower
- `deque.extend(iterable)`: Extend the right side of the deque by appending elements from the iterable argument. 
- `deque.extendleft(iterable)`: Extend the left side of the deque by appending elements from iterable. 

> Note, the series of left appends results in reversing the order of elements in the iterable argument.

#### Remove Elements
- `del deque[index]`
- `deque.pop()`: Remove and return an element from the right side of the deque. If no elements are present, raises an `IndexError`. 
- `deque.popleft()`: Remove and return an element from the left side of the deque. If no elements are present, raises an `IndexError`. 
- `deque.remove(value)`: Remove the first occurrence of value. If not found, raises a `ValueError`.

#### Empty `deque`
- `deque *= 0`: slower
- `deque.clear():` Remove all elements from the deque leaving it with length 0. 

#### Reverse `deque`
- `reverse()`: Reverse the elements of the deque in-place and then return `None`.
- `reversed(deque)`: reversed copy that references the original deque, returns an iterator that yields items in reverse order

#### Rotate `deque`
- `rotate(n)`: Rotate the deque n steps to the right. If n is negative, rotate to the left. 

#### Slicing
`deque` do not support built-in slicing. To implement deque slicing, use a similar approach applying `rotate()` to bring a target element to the left side of the deque. Remove old entries with `popleft()`, add new entries with `extend()`, and then reverse the rotation.

## 1.A2 `defaultdict`
```python
class collections.defaultdict(default_factory=None, [, ...]) 
```

Return a new dictionary-like object. `defaultdict` is a subclass of the built-in `dict` class. It overrides one method and adds one writable instance variable. The remaining functionality is the same as for the `dict` class and is not documented here.

The first argument provides the initial value for the `default_factory` attribute; it defaults to `None`. All remaining arguments are treated the same as if they were passed to the dict constructor, including keyword arguments.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

s = [('yellow', 1), ('blue', 2), ('yellow', 3), ('blue', 4), ('red', 1)]
d = defaultdict(list)
for k, v in s:
    d[k].append(v)
```

When each key is encountered for the first time, it is not already in the mapping; so an entry is automatically created using the `default_factory` function which returns an empty list. The `list.append()` operation then attaches the value to the new list. When keys are encountered again, the look-up proceeds normally (returning the list for that key) and the `list.append()` operation adds another value to the list.
